The script run_all.sh use the Dockerfile to create the ccocha/test2 image and perform benchmarking in local machine
The results are stored in iotest folder

$bash run_all.sh

Make sure you have installed python and the required libraries in local machine.
To fix this I plan to install python in the image.
